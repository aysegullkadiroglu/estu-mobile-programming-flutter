<h1>BIM493 Project</h1>

Varsa Paran is a flutter application where you can see stock market tracking.

The UI designs of our user-friendly application have been carefully studied in order to be aware of the current market prices. Its user interface has a more vivid color and a structure that does not tire the eyes. Searched for similar applications in the Play Store (etc. canlıdöviz and midas), and the application developed is different from other applications, as it allows the user to chat actively with other users in the application and view the developments/news in the stock market.

Varsa Paran includes four different menus after the user logs in to our application: stock status of companies in the stock market, currency converter, messaging section and market news. With this, the application became functional and appeals to the user more.

<h1>Major Features</h1>

- The user can log in from the ‘Login Screen’ after entering the phone number and password.
![Login Screen](https://github.com/aysegullkadiroglu/estu-mobile-programming-flutter/assets/46954286/a50668bf-67c5-45d9-86c4-7da3511eb947)

- When the user forgets his password, he clicks on 'I forgot my password' and is directed to that page. As a result of our research, users who forget their passwords are asked for their mobile phone number, so we found this more appropriate.
